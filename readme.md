This is not a production project, but a scaffolded kit to make developing a Node MySQL API quicker.

You will have to add your own .env file with the relevant info like:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=letmein
DB_NAME=patientsdb
DB_PORT=3306
DB_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10
SERVER_PORT=3000

This kit assumes that you have MySQL installed. You can use the provided init.sql file to create and populate a test database.
